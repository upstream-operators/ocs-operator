# NB: this storagecluster spec doesn't provide you the ability to onboard
# external clients as they require "hostNetwork: true", however setting that
# makes mon to come up on three nodes which is obviously not possible in sno.
# No testing is performed with "hostNetwork: true" and mon set to 1 and if
# that works, external clients can be onboarded (after opening required ports).
